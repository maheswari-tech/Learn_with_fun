# Learn_With_Fun

"Learn_With_Fun" is an innovative educational platform developed during a hackathon by a dedicated team of four. This project aims to provide *quality gamified learning materials* for underprivileged children of underpriviledged, primarily targeting students from **Grade 1 to 5*.  

🌟 Project Vision
Many children from marginalized communities struggle to access quality education, especially those involved in rag picking. *Learn_With_Fun* bridges this gap by offering an engaging learning platform that is both educational and accessible.

🎯 Key Features
- Student Registration: Students sign up with their email, password, and school details to create a personalized learning account.
- Gamified Learning: Interactive learning materials (games) focused on English, Math, and other subjects designed to make education fun and engaging.
- Prototype Focus: Our initial prototype includes comprehensive learning materials for Grade 1 students.
- Assessment and Recognition: After completing the learning modules, students take assessments. If a student performs exceptionally:
  - An *automated email* is sent to nearby *NGOs* and the respective *schools* to *recognize their talent*.
  - Recognized students may be considered for *scholarships* or provided with tools (e.g., tablets) to support their learning journey.
  
💡 How It Works
1. Sign Up: Students register with their email, password, school name, and other details.
2. Learn: Access engaging learning materials tailored to Grade 1 (more grades in future versions).
3. Assessments: Students complete assessments to test their understanding and progress.
4. Recognition and Support: Exceptional performance triggers notifications to NGOs and schools for potential scholarships or learning resources.
